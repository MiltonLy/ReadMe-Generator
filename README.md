## Description

This App will generate a structured ReadMe file for you after filling out a short questionaire.

## Usage Instruction

This app runs on node.js so first you must install node.js through homebrew or the node.js website. Once you have downloaded node.js, you can open this app in terminal. After opening the terminal, move to the assets folder. Inside the assets folder, you will type in the command 

```node index.js ```

This will run the function to generate a new ReadMe after filling out the questions that the terminal prompts.

Below is a link to a video walk through of how it app will run.

## Learning Point

This assignment allowed me to practice my node.js skills and inputs. I learned how to use the inquirer function and how to use those prompts to show a question, then with those answers to the question I was able to append them into a new file of my choice.
